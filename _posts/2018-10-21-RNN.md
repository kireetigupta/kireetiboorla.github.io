## What are RNNs ?
Re-currant neural networks where the state of the current system is a combination of current and previous information fed into the network.

### What are they used for ?
1. Language Modeling and Generating Text
2. Machine Translation
3. Speech Recognition
4. Generating Image Descriptions


RNNs are trained using "Back-propagation through time". The vanilla BPTT suffers with vanishing gradient problem and is dealt with concepts like LSTMs.

Bidirectional RNNs:
Two RNNs stacked together. Output from both is function of hidden states of the two RNNs.
DeepBidirection RNNs:
Multiple Bidirectional RNNs with multiple layers per time step.

LSTM:
