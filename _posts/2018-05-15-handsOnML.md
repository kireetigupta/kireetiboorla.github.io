## Challenges in Machine Learning.
#### Insufficient quantity of training data.
If the training data is not covering all the classes or is not exhaustive then the models do not learn appropriately. 
Even simple models can perform at par with complex models given appropriate amount of data. 
#### Biased data.
If the training data is not representative then the learning is limited.
