### Why do we need feature scaling ? 
1. Feature scaling reduces the biased impact of different features and gives equal probability for all the features to have an effect
on the outcome. 
2. Modeling is based on the assumption that the features follow the same "co-ordinates system"
3. Unscaled feature set individually also can have bizzare effects. 
4. Read [this](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/41704/how-and-why-do-normalization-and-feature-scaling-work?newreg=cb1ec1dda52e45b3be7d1688a57d07ad)
