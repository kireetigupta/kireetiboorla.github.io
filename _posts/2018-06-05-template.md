## Data preperation

### 1. Dealing with Null values
Figure out if there are any null value columns and deal with them appropriately.
1. If numerical consider mean
2. If categorical consider mode.

Impl:
use sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer with appropriate strategy to use the same for test data as well.
(learn how to use imputer from the pipeline)

### 2. Categorical features.
Use onehot encoding to deal with this.

Impl:
1. factorize using series.factorize()
2. feed it into OneHotEncoder.fit_transform

### 3. Standardize numerical columns
Use standard normalization to normalize the numerical columns
Impl: use from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler to normalize.

## Feature engineering
### Intutive guess of feature importance.
Go through feature descriptions and see what are important

### Visualization
Using plots (Scatter plots, histograms) find the important features.
Compute statistics such as variance etc.
