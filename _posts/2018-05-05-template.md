## Data preperation

### 1. Dealing with Null values 
Figure out if there are any null value columns and deal with them appropriately.
1. If numerical consider mean
2. If categorical consider mode. 

Impl:
use sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer with appropriate strategy to use the same for test data as well. 

### 2. Categorical features. 
Use onehot encoding to deal with this.

Impl:
1. factorize using series.factorize()
2. feed it into OneHotEncoder.fit_transform
